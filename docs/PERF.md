# Performance vs Boehm (Linux)

**Canonical cut numbers for version bumps live here (Linux only).** macOS: [PERF-macos.md](PERF-macos.md).

**One number:** `gcry req/s ÷ Boehm req/s` on the same host. Prefer **`/json`**. Absolute wrk is noise; **% of Boehm** is the score.

Load: `bench/kemal`, `wrk -c 100 -d 30`, fresh process per path, `--release` (`-Dgc_none` for gcry).

**RSS:** after wrk, `GET /gc-collect`, then read process RSS (`ps` / VmRSS) — end-of-run noise otherwise dominates.

## Headline (v0.16.0) — Linux *(measured)*

Same host, Crystal 1.21.0, WSL2 x86_64 (i3-12100F), median of 3, pure `--release`, **in-header MARK** (default), scrub **on** (EC1 **4 KiB** blind parked-fiber clear), auto-layouts **off**, EC1 non-atomic heap counters. Session: `bench/log/linux/2026-08-01-093130/` (`cb4d7f2`); idle `/` from `slash-recut/` (same binaries; first `/` pass noisy).

| Path | % of Boehm | post-GC RSS × |
|------|----------:|--------------:|
| `/json` | **~87%** | **~0.80×** |
| `/` | **~82%** | **~0.79×** |

Alloc-heavy `/json` is the gate. Idle `/` is sanity. **0.16.0 recovers EC1 thr** after Parallel-era STW/scrub/counter fallout (fair Boehm ~40k baseline). **v0.17–v0.18** carry this Linux Kemal headline. Fat-app (acikturkiye): tagged v0.17 i3 cut was thr **~90%** @ RSS **~3.43×** (`2026-08-02-064142/`); **v0.18 after finalizer + Linux retain=0** is thr **~90–96%** @ RSS **~1–1.6×** (i3 headline **~96%** @ **~1.63×**; 9950X **~90–102%** @ **~1.0–1.8×**) — [ACIKTURKIYE.md](ACIKTURKIYE.md). Opt-in `GCRY_TIGHT_GROW=1` closes the freelist residual on acik (**~103%** @ **~0.92×**, `…/acik-tight-grow-v2-med3/`); Kemal `/json` soft (~**78%**) — not default. Quiet Kemal smokes land **~80–85%** `/json` @ **~0.74–0.79×** (host/Boehm noise; retain=0 no cliff) — **headline stays the v0.16 cut above**.

### Tip default-path re-cut — first cut with fiber scrub **off**

The tip default drops parked-fiber scrub ([SOUND-DEFAULTS.md](SOUND-DEFAULTS.md)
§ "What `scrub_fibers` costs"), so every number above was produced by a
configuration that is no longer the default. Re-cut on the same host
(i3-12100F), Crystal 1.21.0, median of 3, `wrk -c 100 -d 30`, `--release`.
Session: `bench/log/linux/2026-08-09-060252/`.

| Path | Boehm req/s | gcry req/s | % of Boehm | post-GC RSS × |
|------|------------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------------:|
| `/json` | 43,008 | 35,022 | **81.4%** | **0.77×** |
| `/` | 84,482 | 74,725 | **88.5%** | **0.76×** |

This lands inside the quiet-smoke band this host has carried since v0.16
(~80–85% `/json` @ ~0.74–0.79×), so **the headline does not move on this
evidence** — three trials cannot resolve a difference this size against a
6–8% run spread. What it does establish is the thing that mattered: dropping
the scrub default costs nothing visible end to end.

The axis that *can* resolve the knob is the per-collection trace, where the
effect is not diluted by the process around it. Kemal `/json`, EC1, 9 paired
reps interleaved and order-rotated, ~1050 steady-state collections per config
(`bench/log/linux/2026-08-09-061508-root-phase/`), `tuned` = the tip default
(scrub off), `scrub` = the old default restored with `GCRY_SCRUB_FIBERS=1`:

| Config | roots µs | scrub µs | stacks µs | Δ root work | Δ pause | post-GC RSS |
|--------|---------:|---------:|----------:|------------:|--------:|------------:|
| tuned (scrub off) | 196.6 | 0.0 | 14.0 | +0.0% | +0.0% | 12,220 KiB |
| scrub on | 192.4 | 27.5 | 14.5 | **+11.2%** | **+5.9%** | 12,488 KiB |

Turning scrub back on costs 11.2% more root work and 5.9% more pause, and
**does not buy the retention it was turned on for** — post-GC RSS is 2.2%
*higher* with it on, which at 9 reps is a wash rather than a reversal, but it
is certainly not the reduction that justified the default. The +11.2% agrees
in sign and rough magnitude with the −9.1% recorded for the opposite direction
in `…-195929-root-phase/`.

### Sound-roots cut — what the default heuristics actually cost

Every number above is measured with gcry's **root-completeness heuristics
armed**: base-pointer-only ambient roots, the static-root `type_id` gate,
256 KiB STW stack/pthread lags, and parked-fiber scrub. Each of those can
decline to mark a pointer that is genuinely live, so a throughput number
produced with them on does not answer "what does a *correct* gcry cost?".

`GCRY_SOUND=1` turns the whole class off. Same host, same session, `wrk -c 100
-d 20`, median of 7 — `bench/log/linux/2026-08-06-052109-sound-profile/`
(`make bench-sound-profile`). Each `sound` row is confirmed applied via its own
`/gc-stats` `root_soundness`, not assumed from the env var.

| Kemal `/json` config | % of Boehm | post-GC RSS × | run spread |
|----------------------|-----------:|--------------:|-----------:|
| tuned (process defaults) | 78.3% | **0.795×** | 5.06% |
| sound roots (`GCRY_SOUND=1`) | 81.0% | **0.794×** | 6.54% |
| sound + conservative bodies (`+GCRY_DISABLE_LAYOUT=1`) | 84.4% | **0.797×** | 10.47% |

**RSS does not move — that reproduces across two sessions.** Throughput did not
resolve, and the table above carries the defect that explains why: **WSL2 steps
`CLOCK_REALTIME` backwards ~1.6 s every ~32 s** and wrk derives its duration
from that clock, so any pass containing a step reports ~19% high. A 10 s pass
catches one about a third of the time, and which config it lands on is random —
so it biased the comparison, not just widened it. That is the mechanism behind
"sound ahead of tuned", and the rows above should be read as suspect for that
reason as well as the retracted ~1pp figure (which predated the raw-buffer fix).

`bench/sound_profile_ab.sh` now times passes with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and takes
wrk's request count rather than its rate.

That was one of four defects, all of them **bias rather than variance** — which
is why more runs never helped:

1. wrk's rate came from a clock WSL2 steps backwards (~19% on affected passes).
2. The first fix *discarded* stepped passes, which made the 9×30 s methodology
   impossible — steps arrive faster than a 30 s pass completes.
3. Configs ran as consecutive blocks, confounding config with time: the three
   gcry blocks came out monotonically faster in execution order (+0%, +2.11%,
   +2.80%).
4. Interleaving alone left a fixed order *within* each round. Whichever config
   ran first came out ~2% slow — the same ~2% for three different knob
   configurations, which is position, not knobs.

Fixed: monotonic timing, round-robin interleaving, order rotated each round.
The apparent sound-vs-tuned gap fell +2.27% → +2.11% → **+0.82%** as each
confound came out.

**Result** (`bench/log/linux/2026-08-06-140037-sound-profile/`, 9 rounds × 30 s,
paired): the sound profile is **throughput-neutral** on Kemal `/json` at EC1 —
+0.82% at 1.7σ, not distinguishable from zero. The class costs under ~1% here,
in either direction.

`scrub_fibers` was read as an exception — disabling it appearing to *gain*
**1.29%** (8/9 rounds, 3.2σ) on the 9950X. **That is retracted, along with its
opposite.** A second session, same harness but on the **i3-12100F** (4c/8t, one
12 MiB L3 — not the same machine), measured **−1.22%** (3/9 rounds, 1.25σ, 95%
CI −3.47%…+1.04%): the sign flipped and the significance vanished.

Two different hosts is a weaker comparison than two sessions would have been,
and it is not what retires the claim. What retires it is the arithmetic below,
which is computed from each host's own trace and does not travel between them.

The arithmetic says why, and says no number of rounds would have helped. On
Kemal `/json` at EC1 the collector takes 131 collections per 20 s and spends
223 µs of each on `roots + scrub + stacks` — **0.146% of wall time**. Turning
scrub off moves that by 9.1%, i.e. **0.013% of wall time**. Nothing indirect
picks up the slack either: collection count is identical at 131, mark moves
230→228 µs and sweep 2127→2140 µs. So the mechanism can produce ~0.01%, and
both the +1.29% and the −1.22% are 100× larger than that. **Throughput cannot
resolve this knob on this workload, in either direction** — that is a property
of the effect size, not of the host.

**Default-path control** (`…-153032-sound-profile/`): the branch adds an ivar
load and a branch to the hot mark path. Against `master` built from its own
worktree, both interleaved in one job at default configuration: **+0.12%, 95%
CI −1.42% … +1.66%** — no measurable regression, and the −2.13% figure that
had been carried for this is excluded.

**Re-taken after the low-water skip** (`…-2026-08-07-113415/` and `…-114908/`),
because that skip is *not* gated on `lag == 0` and so is live on the default
path — the control above no longer described the code. Pooled over 18 paired
rounds: **−1.33%, 95% CI −3.00 … +0.34%**, i.e. still no measurable regression.
Read the pair rather than either cut: the first alone gave −2.09% at 2.2σ with
an interval excluding zero, and did not replicate. Turning the skip off moves
the default path by +0.32% (σ 0.4), so it is not the cost either way.

Re-taken on the trace instrument (`…-2026-08-07-041413-root-phase/`), which was
expected to tighten that to ~0.3% SEM. **It does not, and the reason is worth
keeping:** pooling ~1690 collections per build does give SEM ≈ 0.28%, but
collections inside one rep share a server process, a heap layout and a CPU
placement — they are not independent. The unit of replication is the rep (n=9),
per-rep medians scatter 2–3%, and the paired bound comes out **+1.11%, 95% CI
−0.63% … +2.85%** on `roots+static+stacks+mark` — no tighter than throughput
gave. The added guards live in `mark_ns` as well as `roots_ns`, so a
`roots_ns`-only bound would also have measured half the change.

That run *does* resolve one thing: post-GC RSS is **+1.63%, 95% CI +0.58% …
+2.68%** (t=3.59), i.e. 264 KiB. Not binary size (the branch binary is 8 KiB
larger); most likely two 128 KiB size-class chunks of allocator granularity,
since both new flags default to false and the guarded expressions are then
semantically identical to master's. Unproven either way.

### Noise floor — what this harness can and cannot resolve

Measured, not assumed: the same build run against itself, 12 reps × 30 s
(`bench/log/linux/2026-08-07-050658-root-phase/FINDINGS.md`). Paired deltas come
out ~0 as they must; the interval is the point.

| metric | null Δ | 95% CI | per-rep sd |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| roots | +0.21% | −1.98 … +2.40% | 1.99% |
| mark | +0.92% | −2.41 … +4.26% | 2.08% |
| pause | +0.72% | −1.73 … +3.17% | 1.95% |
| **post-GC RSS** | **−0.07%** | **−0.99 … +0.86%** | **0.75%** |

**±2–3pp on phase timings, ±1pp on RSS, at 12 reps.** Post-GC RSS is the
tightest instrument here — roughly 3× tighter than any phase timing, and much
tighter than throughput. Prefer it when a change could plausibly show up in
retention.

The residual scatter is per-process, not environmental: within-rep correlation
between two *identical* configurations is r ≈ 0 in every phase. It is not the
load generator, the clock, thermal drift, CCD/L3 placement, or ASLR — see
ROADMAP. Physical page placement is the leading remaining candidate.

Kemal is also the workload these knobs were *least* expected to matter on —
they were argued on fat-app RSS (fiber scrub at acik 3.00× → 2.65×, the STW
lags at EC4 `phase_roots`).

**Unmeasured in throughput is not free.** The pause cost *has* been measured,
per collection off the `GCRY_TRACE=1` records (`bench/root_phase_ab.sh`), and
it is not small where the root scan is large:

| Cut | tuned pause | `GCRY_SOUND=1` pause | |
|-----|------------:|---------------------:|--|
| Kemal `/json`, EC1 | 398 µs | 398 µs | +0.1% |
| Kemal `/json`, **EC4** | 7.2 ms | **141.7 ms** | **+1866%** |
| acik `/api/v1/`, EC1, heap ≥55 MiB | 17 ms | **213 ms** | **+1347%** *(pre-low-water; re-cut below)* |

Both large numbers are **pre-low-water**. Kemal EC4 re-cut to 13 ms (11.3×
better), and the fat-app row inverted outright — 21 paired reps, stratified by
heap regime (`bench/log/linux/2026-08-09-071144-root-phase/`):

| acik stratum | reps (tuned / sound) | tuned pause | `GCRY_SOUND=1` pause | Δ root work |
|--------------|---------------------:|------------:|---------------------:|------------:|
| small heap (~46 MiB) | 15 / 15 | 2.7 ms | 2.7 ms (+1.7%) | +2.7% |
| large heap (~70 MiB) | 10 / 13 | 24.3 ms | **18.1 ms (−25.4%)** | **−43.8%** |

That table is itself superseded, and the reason is worth keeping: it showed
`GCRY_SOUND=1` coming out *cheaper* than the default, because the low-water skip
applied to `lag = 0` and **not** to the 256 KiB default window. Tuned was
faulting in a fixed window per parked fiber that nothing had ever written.

The skip now applies on the default path too — `max(stack_top − lag, low_water)`
— which reverses it back. Current numbers, Kemal EC4, 9 paired reps, single heap
regime (`bench/log/linux/2026-08-09-104417-root-phase/`):

| config | pause | root work | Δ pause | IQR |
|--------|------:|----------:|--------:|----:|
| `tuned` | **3.60 ms** | **3002 µs** | — | 24% |
| `tuned` + `GCRY_STACK_LOW_WATER=0` | 8.06 ms | 7424 µs | +124.1% | 12% |
| `GCRY_SOUND=1` | 16.39 ms | 15 777 µs | +355.8% | 63% |

**Kemal EC4 pause 8.06 → 3.60 ms**, post-GC RSS flat to 0.2%, `mark` and `sweep`
unchanged. On the fat app's ~72 MiB regime the same ordering holds — tuned
10.7 ms, old default 28.8 ms, sound 18.2 ms (`…-105503-root-phase/`, softer:
see that session's FINDINGS for the thread-count confound).

`lag = 0` stays the wrong default: the skip makes the *bounded* scan cheap, not
the complete scan affordable. Kemal EC1 is untouched by construction —
`multi_mutator_threads?` is false at 2 threads, so the lag branch is
unreachable there.

In every case the entire cost is the two STW lag knobs — the other five
heuristics stay within ±6%. They are not EC4-specific: they bite whenever the
root scan is expensive, whether from thread count or heap size. Full method,
per-knob decomposition, and the limits of each cut:
[SOUND-DEFAULTS.md](SOUND-DEFAULTS.md).

**Those rows are pre-fix.** `lag = 0` scanned each parked fiber's whole 8 MiB of
reserved stack, of which 0.05% has ever been written. Scanning now starts at the
stack's low-water mark — identical words, since a page that was never faulted is
zero — and EC4 falls to **13 ms against tuned's 7.1 ms** (was 147 ms in the same
run). RSS unchanged. 9950X:
`bench/log/linux/2026-08-07-110231-root-phase/FINDINGS.md`.

Quote that as a pair rather than as "+83%". The default path has since been
given the same skip, which halves `tuned` and leaves `sound` where it was, so
the ratio moved without the residual moving — i3 after the change: tuned
3.60 ms, sound 16.39 ms. The fat-app row was re-cut too, and reversed sign; see
the stratified table above.

### Supported Parallel opt-in (TLAB off + lazy sweep) — v0.17.0

Not the process default — apps must `ExecutionContext.default.resize(N)`
(`EC_PARALLELISM=N` in kemal benches). Keep **`GCRY_TLAB` off**; lazy
post-STW sweep is default for that shape (`GCRY_DISABLE_LAZY_SWEEP=1`
escapes). Soft soak **0/40**. Quiet cut:

| Path | % of Boehm | gcry (med) | pause p50 | RSS × | Session |

`GCRY_KEEP_CHUNKS=1` re-measured in the 0.18 campaign (**95%** `/json` @ **3.07×** RSS) — see notes below; not a release headline. Soft-dirty nursery stays opt-in (HTTP too dirty for a win). Side bitmap: the `-Dgcry_side_bitmap` build flag of this era is **gone** — mark bitmaps are now per-chunk and runtime-selected (`GCRY_BITMAP=1`); the numbers in the escape table below stand as the record of the side-mmap arm.

Linux Kemal not re-cut. |
| **0.19.0** | *(carry 0.16)* | *(carry 0.16)* | *(carry)* | **Correctness, not perf: a suspended thread's GP registers were unscanned on Darwin (empty stub) and on Linux aarch64 (`NGREGS = 0`), so a reference the compiler never spilled had no root.** Both fixed and gated (`thread_greg_candidates`, `make greg-roots`); the aarch64 half was found by that gate on its first CI run. Darwin fat-app re-cut ~**98%** @ ~**0.97×** (n=9) — replaces the ~0.63×, and gcry's RSS is within 0.6% of it. **No Linux number was re-measured.** |

**Escape knobs (same era, not defaults):**

| Config | `/` | `/json` | RSS × | Note |
|--------|----:|--------:|------:|------|
| 0.5.0 + `GCRY_RELEASE_CHUNKS=1` | ~56% | ~49% | — | release too early to be default |
| 0.6.0 + `GCRY_RELEASE_CHUNKS=1` | ~92% | ~92% | — | thr cost for RSS |
| 0.7-dev + keep chunks | — | ~100% | high | empty retain ≈ waste |
| 0.7-dev Phase 12 (pre-tag) | — | ~93% | ~0.93× | release default-on landed |
| `GCRY_KEEP_CHUNKS=1` (0.18 campaign re-cut) | **~89%** | **~95%** | **~3.07×** | thr escape only — `2026-08-02-121411/` |
| `GCRY_TIGHT_GROW=1` (0.18) | **~95%** | **~78%** | **~0.78×** | fat-app RSS win; Kemal thr soft — `2026-08-04-085740/` |
| side bitmap build flag (pre-0.12 A/B) | **~78%** | **~82%** | **~9.2×** | side mmap marks; see `bench/log/bitmap-ab/FINDINGS.txt`. The flag is removed — marks are header-generation by default, per-chunk bitmap under `GCRY_BITMAP=1` |

Detail tables for 0.7–0.9 cuts lived in git history / CHANGELOG; headline numbers above are the ones to cite. Fat-app (Linux): [ACIKTURKIYE.md](ACIKTURKIYE.md).

## Pauses

`Gcry.pause_stats` — ring of last 64 STW pauses: `last_ns`, `p50_ns`, `p99_ns`, `max_ns`, `total_ns`, `count`.

Default process GC = **full STW majors**. `GCRY_INCREMENTAL=1` + a dirty barrier can re-scan pages before sweep; nursery (`GCRY_NURSERY`) stays off for process HTTP unless you are measuring p99. Soft-dirty is **Linux-only**.

The one pause cliff worth knowing about is the STW root-scan lag pair, which
`GCRY_SOUND=1` zeroes. It used to cost 19× at Kemal EC4 and 14.5× on a fat app;
since the low-water skip that is 1.03× at the `make stw-lag-pause` shape, and on
the fat app's large-heap regime `GCRY_SOUND=1` is now 25% *cheaper* than the
default. `make stw-lag-pause` (`bench/stw_lag_pause.cr`)
reproduces it in ~6 s without a server or an EC build, and gates it in CI —
[SOUND-DEFAULTS.md](SOUND-DEFAULTS.md#guarding-it).

## Secondary suite — crystal-metric (GC subset)

**Not a ship headline.** Product bar stays Kemal `/json` + [ACIKTURKIYE.md](ACIKTURKIYE.md).

Vendored [kostya/crystal-metric](https://github.com/kostya/crystal-metric) under `bench/crystal_metric/`. Same-host Boehm vs gcry **wall time**, **one fresh OS process per bench** (avoids suite-order pollution — shared-process `JsonParsePure` after `JsonGenerate` falsely looked ~20×). Filters: `FILTER=gc|core|stress|all` — see `bench/crystal_metric/README.md`. Compute-bound language benches (Mandelbrot, Nbody, …) are noise — omit from GC claims.

```sh
make bench-crystal-metric
# smoke: TRIALS=1 FILTER=Binarytrees,JsonParsePure,Threadring bash bench/run_crystal_metric_ab.sh
```

### Shared-process cut (superseded methodology)

`bench/log/linux/2026-08-03-crystal-metric-ec1/` — useful only as a cautionary tale (Pure/Primes inflated by prior benches). Prefer process-fresh cuts below.

### Process-fresh cut (cite this)

Session: `bench/log/linux/2026-08-03-crystal-metric-fresh/` (WSL2 i3-12100F, Crystal 1.21, med-of-3, `FILTER=gc`).

| Bench | speed % Boehm | wall × | Notes |
|-------|-------------:|-------:|-------|
| Brainfuck / Brainfuck2 / Matmul / JsonGenerate | **~100–112%** | ~0.9–1.0× | near parity / slight win |
| Threadring | **~97%** | ~1.03× | Channel/fiber |
| RegexDna | **~88%** | ~1.13× | |
| JsonParsePull / Serializable | **~70%** | ~1.4× | typed/pull JSON |
| Revcomp / Knuckeotide | **~58–72%** | ~1.4–1.7× | string/Hash |
| Binarytrees | **~32%** | ~3.1× | tree churn |
| JsonParsePure | **~16%** | ~6.4× | `JSON::Any` Hash forest (was ~20× shared-process) |
| Primes | **~14%** | ~7.3× | sieve alloc storm (real; not order artifact) |

Peak RSS × (median of per-bench peaks): **~0.63×**. Checksum `err` on Crystal ≥1.21 is OK for timing. Do **not** cite the upstream award total as a gcry score.

## How to record (Linux)

Same-day gcry + Boehm, both paths → update **this** file and the README Linux table. Do **not** overwrite these tables with macOS wrk — use [PERF-macos.md](PERF-macos.md).

```sh
make bench-kemal-wrk
LABEL=linux-$(date +%Y%m%d) ./bench/median_kemal_boehm.sh
LABEL=linux-$(date +%Y%m%d) ./bench/median_acikturkiye_boehm.sh
# or: GC=both COUNT=1 TRIALS=3 bash bench/run_all.sh all
# after wrk: curl …/gc-collect && read RSS
# secondary: make bench-crystal-metric
```

# Hardening & knobs

Stress the collector. Tune process GC. Know where false retention comes from.

## Stress

| Suite | Mode |
|-------|------|
| `crystal spec` (+ `spec/stress_spec.cr`) | Library `Gcry::Heap` under Boehm |
| `samples/stress.cr` | Process GC (`-Dgc_none`) |

```sh
crystal spec
crystal build -Dgc_none samples/stress.cr -o bin/stress && ./bin/stress 300
# optional: per-chunk mark bitmaps — GCRY_BITMAP=1 ./bin/stress 300
```

## Defaults that matter (process GC)

- Marks live in the **BlockHeader** (mark generation byte). Per-chunk mark bitmaps are **opt-in** (`GCRY_BITMAP=1`) — the bits ride in each chunk's own header, so there is no side mmap and no RSS tail
- Majors: Linux **32 MiB**, Darwin **16 MiB**; **full STW**; nursery / incremental **off** (opt in `GCRY_NURSERY=1` / `GCRY_INCREMENTAL=1`)
- **Adaptive nursery threshold** when nursery is on (target survival 50%, clamped [64 KiB, 8 MiB]). Disable with `GCRY_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_NURSERY=1`
- Empty chunks **released** (`GCRY_KEEP_CHUNKS=1` to retain); dormant retain budget: Linux **0**, Darwin **512 KiB** (`GCRY_EMPTY_CHUNK_RETAIN`)
- Base-pointer-only ambient roots; root **type_id** gate **on**; layout scan **on**; **SP clamp** **on**; page **blacklist** **on** (Linux + Darwin; `GCRY_DISABLE_BLACKLIST=1` to opt out)
- Fiber stack scrub **off** (was on through v0.18; `GCRY_SCRUB_FIBERS=1` to opt in)
- Base-ptr roots, the type_id gate, the STW stack/pthread lags, the blacklist —
  and fiber scrub when it is opted in — are **root-completeness heuristics**:
  each can decline to mark a pointer that is genuinely live. (Layout scan is a
  *separate* axis: body-scan precision, not root completeness.) `GCRY_SOUND=1`
  turns the whole class off in one flag — that is the configuration whose
  numbers belong in a correctness claim. See [SOUND-DEFAULTS.md](SOUND-DEFAULTS.md)
- Size-class chunk: library/Linux **128 KiB**; Darwin process **256 KiB** (`GCRY_CHUNK_BYTES` to override)
- Large-object freelist retain: Linux process **0**, Darwin **1 MiB** (`GCRY_LARGE_CACHE`; adaptive grows only from a non-zero floor, up to 32 MiB)
- Free-page physical release: **opt-in on both platforms** (`GCRY_PAGE_DONTNEED=1`). Linux HOLED was already opt-in (measured thr+RSS regression as default); Darwin shipped it **on** until 0.21.0 and it is off now, because the walk is unsound and the defect is open — see the knob table below. Escape: `GCRY_DISABLE_PAGE_RELEASE=1` / `GCRY_DISABLE_MADVISE=1`
- Auto-collect suppressed while finalizers run

Pauses: `Gcry.pause_stats`. HTTP: `GET /gc-stats`, `GET /gc-collect`, `GET /metrics` under `-Dgc_none`.

Raising `GCRY_THRESHOLD` cuts major count but grows pause p50 — measure on the real app before changing the default.

## Env reference

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `GCRY_THRESHOLD` | Bytes since last major (Linux default **32 MiB**; Darwin process **16 MiB**) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_AUTO=1` | No auto-collect |
| `GCRY_NURSERY` | Opt-in nursery (bytes; default threshold **512 KiB** when enabled). Process GC default **off** |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_NURSERY=1` | Force nursery off |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_NURSERY=1` | Use fixed nursery threshold (no auto-tuning) |
| `GCRY_SOFT_DIRTY_MAX` | Dirty/total % cap for soft-dirty scan (default **25**) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_SOFT_DIRTY=1` | No soft-dirty |
| `GCRY_MPROTECT_BARRIER=1` | Force mprotect+SEGV barrier |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_MPROTECT=1` | Forbid mprotect |
| `GCRY_INCREMENTAL=1` | Sliced majors (+ dirty re-scan if barrier armed) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_INCREMENTAL=1` | Full STW (process default) |
| `GCRY_INCREMENTAL_WORK` | Objects per slice (default **1024**) |
| `GCRY_BITMAP=1` | Mark bits in a per-chunk bitmap (one bit per block, in the chunk's own header) instead of the mark-generation byte in each `BlockHeader`. Opt-in, **default off** — the header path stays the shipping representation until a Kemal + acikturkiye cut says otherwise, and it is also the fallback on a CPU without the SIMD baseline. Read once at heap `initialize`: a chunk's `data_offset` is baked in at `map_chunk`, so it cannot change under a live heap |
| `GCRY_CHUNK_RADIX=1` | Address→chunk through a two-level page-granular table instead of a binary search over the address-sorted index. Opt-in, **default off**. The fast path is used only where `chunk_containing` already skips `@index_lock` (a stopped world), because the lookup's containment check dereferences the chunk and a stale entry read against an unmapped VMA would fault. ~8 bytes of resident table per page of heap. Counters `radix_fast_hits` / `radix_slow_lookups` / `radix_oversize_skips` |
| `GCRY_RADIX_THP=1` | Leave the chunk-radix tables eligible for transparent huge pages. **Default off**: with THP in `always`, one touched entry faults a 2 MiB page and the table's RSS stops tracking the live heap — measured +16–21% post-GC RSS on Kemal, 160× the naive estimate. The huge page does give the table a single TLB entry, so this exists to A/B whether `MADV_NOHUGEPAGE` costs any of the mark-phase win |
| `GCRY_BITMAP_ALLOC=1` | Implies `GCRY_BITMAP`, and goes further: `occ` bitmaps, a streaming `occ &= mark` sweep, and pool-cursor allocation instead of the freelist. Opt-in, **default off**, still being built out — nursery chunks are excluded (their allocation is still `alloc_nursery`'s freelist, so `occ` is not maintained for them). Retires the mark union, because a bitmap-only sweep cannot see a mark that exists only in a header generation |
| `GCRY_PREFETCH=0` | Disable the mark-loop software prefetch pipeline (default **on**). The pipeline prefetches each object's cache line a fixed depth before it is scanned, hiding the random-access miss that dominates a latency-bound mark; `=0` selects the plain LIFO drain for A/B |
| `GCRY_ALLOC_PFW` | Bytes ahead of the bitmap allocation cursor to prefetch-for-write (default **2048**, 0 disables). Overlaps the fresh-line write miss with `set_used` and the caller's zeroing; sweet spot is machine-dependent |
| `GCRY_HUGEPAGES=1` | Ask for transparent huge pages on GC chunks (default **off** — chunks are `MADV_NOHUGEPAGE`). **Currently a no-op, and measurably so**: chunks are 128 KiB separate mmaps and THP can only back a ≥2 MiB region inside one VMA, so the advice cannot be honoured. It needs the reserved arena (plan Phase 8) to mean anything; the knob is the mechanism, kept so the arena work has somewhere to land |
| `GCRY_SIMD` | SIMD tier for the bitmap kernels: `off`/`scalar`/`none`, `neon`, `avx2`, `avx512`. Clamps **down** only — naming a tier the CPU lacks would be a SIGILL, so an unsupported or unrecognised value falls back to what `cpuid` detected. Default: detected. `off` is the A/B arm that separates a vector-kernel bug from a representation bug |
| `GCRY_LARGE_RELEASE_FROM_BASE=1` | Research/positive control only: restore the pre-0.21.4 lower bound in the large-freelist page release, which started the range at the chunk base and so covered the chunk's own header page. `madvise_range_ok?` refuses those ranges, so this is how `make large-freelist-madvise` proves its guard has teeth. Never set it in production |
| `GCRY_STRESS=1` | Collect every N allocs (`GCRY_STRESS_EVERY`, default **16**) |
| `GCRY_KEEP_CHUNKS=1` | Retain empty chunks (higher thr / RSS) |
| `GCRY_RELEASE_CHUNKS=1` | Force empty release (already default-on) |
| `GCRY_EMPTY_CHUNK_RETAIN` | Dormant empty-byte budget (process: Linux **0**, Darwin **512 KiB**; library **0**) |
| `GCRY_EMPTY_CHUNK_WARM_RETAIN` | Mapped warm empty-byte budget before dormant/munmap (research; not default) |
| `GCRY_TIGHT_GROW=1` | Sticky newest-chunk freelist + sparse GC-before-grow (fat-app RSS; Kemal thr soft — not default) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_TIGHT_GROW=1` | Force tight-grow off |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_TIGHT_GROW_GC=1` | Prefer-freelist only (no GC-before-grow) |
| `GCRY_PRECISE_STACK=1` | Load `.llvm_stackmaps` + hybrid precise walker (additive; see [STACK_MAPS.md](STACK_MAPS.md)) |
| `GCRY_PRECISE_STACK=2` | **Research:** exclusive precise stacks (no conservative stack word scan; UAF risk) |
| `GCRY_PARALLEL_DORMANT=1` | Parallel: DONTNEED empties within retain (keeps post-STW lazy sweep) |
| `GCRY_PARALLEL_DORMANT_ALL=1` | Parallel: DONTNEED every empty (legacy; thr↓) |
| `GCRY_PARALLEL_RELEASE=1` | **Unsupported** — Parallel munmap excess (forces in-STW sweep; can hang). stderr warn; prefer `GCRY_PARALLEL_DORMANT=1` |
| `GCRY_SOUND=1` | **Soundness profile** — turns off every heuristic that can decline to mark a live pointer (interiors on, misaligned interiors on, static roots on, type_id gate off, STW lags 0, fiber scrub off, blacklist off) and pins the barrier axis (nursery/incremental off). Applied before the individual knobs, so any explicit `GCRY_*` still wins — and the `soundness` field on `/gc-stats` demotes to `sound-roots-only` / `tuned` when one does. See [SOUND-DEFAULTS.md](SOUND-DEFAULTS.md) |
| `GCRY_INTERIOR=1` | Interior pointers on ambient roots |
| `GCRY_UNALIGNED_CANDIDATES=1` | Follow misaligned candidate values (`str.to_unsafe + 3`); implied by `GCRY_SOUND` |
| `GCRY_ALIGNED_CANDIDATES=1` | Force the cheap alignment filter back on (escape from `GCRY_SOUND`) |
| `GCRY_PAGE_DONTNEED=1` | Sparse free-page release, **opt-in on Linux and Darwin alike** (Darwin was default-on before 0.21.0). **Known unsound:** the post-STW walk madvises a free-page run computed from a live-mask taken in the pause, and a mutator can allocate into that run before the syscall — `MADV_DONTNEED` then zeroes a live object. `make page-release-corruption` faulted **4 of 28** attempts on this arm across six 0.21.x gate runs, against **0** throughout for `GCRY_MOSTLY_EMPTY=1` and `GCRY_DISABLE_MADVISE=1`. Re-measured after the 0.21.2 chunk-index fix: **1 of 40** in the gate plus **2 of 100** direct children — and every remaining failure is *checksum corruption* (`40 corrupt, 0 entirely zero`), no faults. The crash half of the old rate belonged to the hidden-index-entry defect; the zeroing half is this arm's own and remains. Warns at boot. On Darwin the walk visits **every** kept size-class chunk rather than only the HOLED ones, and `MADV_FREE_REUSABLE` zero-fills a reclaimed page, so the same window is reachable there — which is why the Darwin default was turned off rather than papered over. |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_PAGE_RELEASE=1` | Disable free-page reclaim. Now only meaningful alongside `GCRY_PAGE_DONTNEED=1`, since the release is off by default everywhere. |
| `GCRY_LARGE_CACHE` | Large freelist retain (Linux process **0**; Darwin **1 MiB**; adaptive from non-zero) |
| `GCRY_CHUNK_BYTES` | Chunk mmap size (library/Linux default **128 KiB**; Darwin process **256 KiB**) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_TYPE_ID_GATE=1` | Disable root type_id filter |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_LAYOUT=1` | Disable layout-precise scan |
| `GCRY_MOSTLY_EMPTY_UNLINK=1` | Research arm. Unlink free-only page runs from the class freelist while keeping `MADV_FREE`, separating the unlink from the syscall change `GCRY_MOSTLY_EMPTY_MODE=dontneed` makes at the same time. Unlinked blocks do not return without a freelist rebuild, which the SPARSE path deliberately does not do. |
| `GCRY_PAGE_RELEASE_TEST_STALL_MS=N` | Research only. Sleep N ms between building the free-page mask and the release syscalls. Written to widen the window a mutator can allocate into — and it does **not** raise the crash rate: 2 of 12 at 0 ms, 0 of 12 at 2 ms, 0 of 12 at 10 ms. That is evidence against the mask-to-syscall gap being the mechanism behind the `0x18` corruption, and the knob is kept so the next person can re-check it in a minute rather than assuming. |
| `GCRY_THREAD_LIST_TRIPWIRE=1` | Research arm, default **off**. Arms the `ThreadListWatch` instrument family around the runtime's `Thread::LinkedList`: an unlocked pre-`Thread.lock` walk that reports the list reading empty, block `set_free`/`set_used` hooks with a backtrace at a hand-out that covers the object, phase-boundary header probes, a mark-offer reject reporter, and a per-operation chunk-index verifier. This family walked the `0x18` crash to its root — `index_insert_locked` published `@chunk_index_count` after the shift, so a mutator suspended mid-insert hid the boot chunk (always the last, highest-addressed entry) from the whole collection's unlocked index reads; the mark then lost `Thread::LinkedList` to a failed `find_block` and the sweep reclaimed it live — **fixed** (8–44 of 100 children → 0 of 100). Off by default because the walk owns a hazard of its own: a stale `next` from an exited worker can lead it into a legitimately released chunk. `bench/log/linux/2026-08-27-thread-list-tripwire/` |
| `GCRY_DYING_GREG_DUMP=1` | Print every captured GP-register word of every thread at the moment the dying-type audit sees a live object about to be swept. "Not in any register" is a claim about the capture as much as about the value, and the two had never been told apart — this dump is how the all-zeros capture (the `StaticArray` row-copy bug) was found. Needs `GCRY_THREAD_BLOCK_AUDIT=1` to have anything to fire on |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_GREG_ROOTS=1` | Research arm, never a product setting: skip the loop that offers suspended threads' captured registers to the mark, so registers-as-roots can be A/B'd inside **one** binary. Comparing two builds measures the compiler instead — where a value lives moves with any edit to the source. Measured on the `0x18` rate: 14/288 on against 10/288 off, p ≈ 0.5 |
| `GCRY_FULL_SUSPENDED_STACK=1` | Decline the suspended-SP clamp: scan a running fiber's stack from the guard page instead of from the suspended SP. The widest stack-root setting there is; exists so "the root the clamp dropped" can be ruled in or out in one run |
| `GCRY_SUSPENDED_SP_SLACK=N` | Extra bytes **below** a suspended thread's SP kept in the scan, on top of the red zone (`0` restores the old bound). The kernel writes the signal frame below the SP it reports in the `ucontext`, and that frame carries register state the GP-register walk needs |
| `GCRY_ADDRESS_SPACE_REPORT_LIMIT=N` | Raise the per-collection cap on holders the address-space audit names (default **6**). The default keeps a stopped world short; a hunt that needs every holder named — because the one that matters is the one the default did not print — can pay for it |
| `GCRY_MARK_AUDIT_EVERY=N` | Run the mark audit on one collection in N. The full audit is O(live heap) inside the pause and suppresses the very crash it is looking for, so its zero is otherwise only measurable on runs that do not crash. |
| `GCRY_RELEASE_QUARANTINE=N` | Hold a released range `PROT_NONE` for N collections before returning the address to the kernel. Pages are dropped as `munmap` would drop them, so the cost is address space, not RSS. `GCRY_UNMAP_GUARD=1` (never return it at all) removes the acikturkiye crash; this bounds how long the danger lasts. |
| `GCRY_ALWAYS_CLEAR=1` | Research arm: zero every allocation, including the ones whose bytes are already believed zero (fresh `MAP_ANONYMOUS`, clean freelist). Crystal's `Reference.allocate` zeroes nothing itself, so an unassigned ivar reads whatever the previous occupant left. |
| `GCRY_DYING_AUDIT_MIN_BYTES=N` | Ignore dying blocks smaller than N in the dying / address-space audit. That walk fires once per collection and left to itself always picks a small block; this aims the single shot at a size. |
| `GCRY_DYING_AUDIT_MIN_BYTES=N` | Ignore dying blocks smaller than N in the dying/address-space audit. The address-space walk fires once per collection and otherwise always picks a small block; this aims that single shot at a size. |
| `GCRY_LAYOUT_DUMP=1` | Print every layout registration at boot: type name, type_id, and the scan/noscan offsets the macro emitted. A *missing* offset is otherwise invisible — the mark audit can name the type_id that lost an edge but not the type. |
| `GCRY_SCAN_CAPS=1` | Register `instance_sizeof` scan caps for all References (clips size-class padding; fat-app live set often unchanged) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_AUTO_LAYOUTS=1` | When auto-layouts opted in: keep builtins only |
| `GCRY_AUTO_LAYOUTS=1` | Opt-in whole-program precise layouts (Linux Kemal `/json` thr cost ~7pp) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_SP_CLAMP=1` | Full pthread range on other threads |
| `GCRY_STW_STACK_LAG` | Multi-mutator parked-fiber scan depth below `stack_top` (bytes; default **256 KiB**; `0` = full guard→bottom) |
| `GCRY_STW_PTHREAD_LAG` | Multi-mutator pthread scan from stack high when SP is on a fiber (bytes; default **256 KiB**; `0` = full map) |
| `GCRY_STACK_LOW_WATER=0` | Disable the low-water skip (Linux; default **on**). The scan starts at `max(stack_top − lag, low_water)` — a page with neither the present nor the swapped bit in `/proc/self/pagemap` was never faulted, so it is zero and skipping it cannot lose a root. Not a conservatism knob: setting `0` only makes the scan *wider* and slower (Kemal EC4 pause 3.60 → 8.06 ms). Exists for A/B and for a kernel whose pagemap misbehaves; unreadable pagemap already falls back on its own |
| `GCRY_MONITOR_GATE=0` | Let the EC Monitor run inside the stopped world again (default **on**, i.e. shut out). STW never signal-suspends the Monitor — resume races wedged it — and it was measured waking ~100×/s through a 4 s stop and running `StackPool#collect`, which munmaps fiber stacks, while the collector scanned thread stacks. `Gcry::MonitorGate` handshakes it out instead. Measured cost over 3000 collections: zero added pause (`monitor_gate_stw_waits=0`), worst case one in-flight Monitor call. `0` is for A/B and is the old, unsound-by-assumption behaviour |
| `GCRY_STW_WATCHDOG_MS` | Print which phase the collector is stuck in when the world has been stopped longer than this (ms; default **off**). A hang under STW is otherwise silent: every mutator is frozen in `sigsuspend` and `/gc-stats` cannot answer because its thread is suspended too. The watcher is a raw pthread — not a `Crystal::Thread`, so STW does not suspend the one thread whose job is to notice. Costs one sleeping thread while armed; the phase breadcrumb it reads is recorded either way |
| `GCRY_SEGV_REPORT=1` | On SIGSEGV / SIGBUS, print what the heap knows about the faulting address — inside the heap span or not, which block, used or free, the first word of its payload, and whether the freed-block poison is in the faulting context's registers (`0xdeadf2ee…` is non-canonical, so the kernel reports `si_addr` as 0 for it). Then hands the signal back to Crystal's handler, which reports as before. Armed from the **first collection**, not from `GC.init` — Crystal installs its own handler afterwards and discards anything earlier. Default **off**: installing a signal handler is not something a collector should do unasked. `make segv-report` |
| `GCRY_POISON_FREED=1` | Overwrite a freed block's payload with `0xdeadf2eedeadf2ee`. A use-after-free then reads a value that is not a pointer, not zero and not anyone's data, and faults at a non-canonical address instead of at something plausible — the 2026-08-10 soak died on `0x7f1700000149`, which three sessions could not agree about. Sound because the freelist link lives in the block header, not the payload, and because every free path marks the size class's freelist unclean so `malloc`'s clearing fast path still hands out zeros (`make poison-freed` gates both halves). Default **off**: measured **+40%** on the soak's pause p50 (2.72 → 3.81 ms, n=5) |
| `GCRY_POISON_TAG=1` | The poison above, with the freed block's own address in its low 48 bits, so a crash says *which* free wrote what it read instead of only that some free did. Still non-canonical (bits 63:48 are `0xDEAD` and bit 47 of a user-space address is 0), so it faults identically. Implies `GCRY_POISON_FREED` — asking for the tag and not getting poisoned blocks would be a knob that silently does nothing |
| `GCRY_POISON_HOLDERS=1` | And the step after naming the block: naming **what still points at it**. On a fault whose poison names a block, search the explicit root set, every live block in the heap and every fiber stack for that address, and report each holder — the holding block's address, size, `type_id`, flags and mark state with the offset the pointer sits at, or for a stack the slot address, the fiber's `stack_top`, and whether that slot is inside the window the collector actually scans. Finding **nothing** is a result too: the pointer is then in a register, in thread-local storage, or in memory gcry never mapped. Implies the tag and `GCRY_SEGV_REPORT` (the search needs a block address to look for). Costs nothing until something faults. Linux only — the poison is found in the faulting context's registers, and that path is Linux-only. `make poison-holders` |
| `GCRY_STAGED_WAIT=0` | Turn **off** the pre-stop wait for a thread that exists but has not published itself (default **on**). Crystal puts a thread on `Thread.threads` only from inside its own `start`; until then `stop_world` neither suspends nor scans it, and gcry — which records the thread from the moment `pthread_create` returns — waits, briefly and **before taking `Thread.lock`**, for it to appear. Before the lock is not a detail: the thread publishes by taking that very mutex, so waiting under it would deadlock by construction. Measured at 16 workers: crashes **6/60 → 0/60**, census gaps **3/30 → 0/30**, ~1.4% of collections wait at all. A wait that times out drops the staged entries, so a thread that dies before publishing cannot buy a permanent per-collection spin. `0` restores the old behaviour for A/B |
| `GCRY_THREAD_CENSUS=1` | Count, at every `stop_world`, the threads Crystal's list yields against `/proc/self/status:Threads`. A difference is a thread outside the stopped world. Counters `thread_census_checks` / `_gaps` / `_gap_max` / `_unanswered` on `/gc-stats`; the reader returns `nil` rather than 0 when `/proc` cannot answer and `_unanswered` counts those, so "no gaps" can never be the result of never having looked. Default **off**: it reads `/proc` inside the pause. Linux only — Darwin answers `nil` by design |
| `GCRY_MARK_AUDIT=1` | After `mark_loop` and before `sweep`, with the world stopped, walk every marked block and report any base pointer into a **used but unmarked** block — the sweep is about to free something a live object points at. Names the parent's address, `type_id`, size and the offset the pointer sits at, plus the child. Counters `mark_audit_edges` / `mark_audit_misses` on `/gc-stats`, so a quiet run still says whether the mark held. Base pointers only and ATOMIC parents skipped, both to keep false positives from burying a real hit. Default **off**: O(live heap) inside the pause, and it is a debugging instrument, not a safety net — it reports and does not fix. `make mark-audit` |
| `GCRY_THREAD_BLOCK_AUDIT=1` | The same window as `GCRY_MARK_AUDIT`, aimed at one type. After the mark and before the sweep, read Crystal's `type_id` out of every used block and report each one of the watched type that the mark did **not** reach — with whether its address is in a suspended thread's registers and whether the collecting thread's own stack scan offered it — then hand the address to the address-space audit, which names the region that holds it. Watches `Thread`, because gcry has been observed reading a `Thread`'s `@system_handle` out of a block it had already reclaimed and every sighting is on CI. Counters `dying_type_walked` / `dying_type_live` / `dying_type_deaths`: a zero death count from a walk that saw no live blocks of the type is an arm aimed at nothing, not an absence. Implies the address-space walk (`GCRY_ADDRESS_SPACE_AUDIT=0` drops that half and keeps the report). Default **off**; measured at +3% on `stw_mt_property_test` and nothing on the root gates. `make thread-block-audit` |
| `GCRY_DYING_TYPE_ID=<n>` | Point the arm above at another `type_id` instead of `Thread`, and turn it on. This is what makes it testable: the gate aims it at a type whose life and death the harness controls, requires it to name the dropped ones and to stay silent while the same objects are held — so its silence on CI can be read as evidence rather than as an instrument that never ran |
| `GCRY_BIRTH_GRACE=1` | **Research only.** Root every block `allocate` returns for the duration of the next collection, then drop it. Closes the one window in which a block is live in a register or a stack slot and nowhere else — between being handed out and being stored into an object. Runs **after** the mark, so it reports each newborn block the mark did not reach (address, size, first word, collection) before saving it: that is the point, not the saving. Took the fiber-creation use-after-free from 20/48 to **0/48**, and named what it saves — `Fiber` objects mid-`initialize`. Not a fix and never a default: it keeps every allocation alive for a whole collection, which is a retention policy nobody chose. Counters `birth_grace_rooted` / `birth_grace_saved` / `birth_grace_overflows` on `/gc-stats`; the ring is 1 Mi slots and **counts what it drops**, so a null result cannot be a silent cap |
| `GCRY_EC_QUEUE_AUDIT=1` | Walk the Parallel execution context's run queues at every collection, inside the stopped world where they are quiescent, and require every slot to be a **live Fiber** (in the heap, in an allocated block, `Fiber`'s type_id at offset 0). Prints the structure, index and value of the first slot that is not, and counts it on `/gc-stats` (`ec_queue_audit_faults`, cumulative). Exists because the 2026-08-10 soak SEGV'd in `Parallel::Scheduler#quick_dequeue?` an unknown time after whatever overwrote the slot — this names the collection instead of the crash. Default **off**: bounded (ring capacity per scheduler plus the global list) but inside the pause. Gated by `make ec-queue-audit` |
| `GCRY_HEAP_COUNTERS_ATOMIC=0/1` | Pin the allocation counters (`live_objects`, `total_bytes`, `bytes_since_gc`) to the plain or the atomic path. They flip to atomic in `GC.pthread_create`, **before** the call, so a single-threaded program keeps the cheap path and a program that can race never runs without it: measured, four threads on the plain path lose **5 723 of 1 200 000** increments. On x86_64 the "cheap" path was never cheaper — `set(get + n)` compiles to `mov; inc; xchg`, and `xchg` to memory is locked whether you ask or not; on aarch64 the difference is real, which is why the flip is on a second thread and not on always. Pinning survives the flip, which is what makes `make heap-counters` two-directional |
| `GCRY_THREAD_BIRTH_ROOT=0` | Turn **off** rooting the `Thread` object between `pthread_create` returning and the thread publishing itself (default **on**). Crystal passes the `Thread` as `pthread_create`'s `arg`, so the object is already in gcry's hands; without the root its only holder is the new thread's own stack, which `stop_world` has no bounds for and never scans. `make thread-birth-root` |
| `GCRY_THREAD_BIRTH_NOROOT=1` | The twin: record every birth and root **nothing**, so a run that survives cannot be credited to the bookkeeping rather than to the root |
| `GCRY_THREAD_BIRTH_OVERFLOW_UNROOTED=1` | **Research only.** A birth that finds the 64-slot table full goes unrooted — what the table did to every birth past the 64th *between two collections* until 2026-08-22. Slots are freed by a walk that runs inside `stop_world`, so the table holds births since the last collection, not concurrent ones: 65 `Thread.new`s with none in between fill it, 200 overflow it 137 times. An overflow now roots the object anyway and never releases it, which leaks one `Thread` instead of leaving a birth covered by nothing |
| `GCRY_STAGED_NO_EVICT=1` | **Research only.** A full staging table refuses the birth being handed in — the newest, i.e. the thread actually inside the window — instead of draining published entries and, failing that, evicting the oldest. A thread with no record is not waited for before the world stops, so it is neither suspended nor scanned. `make thread-staging` |
| `GCRY_STACK_BOUNDS_NOGROW=1` | **Research only.** Keep the pthread stack-bounds snapshot at its initial 64 entries instead of growing it. A process whose thread list is longer then bounds the first 64 **in list order** and leaves the rest unscanned on the pthread side, every collection: measured, 82 threads gave `visited=64 read=64` — full coverage, said the pair whose whole job is to report a gap — with 18 lookups falling through to `nil` |
| `GCRY_STATIC_BSS_CAP=1` | **Research only.** Refuse a BSS larger than 1 MiB as a root range, which is what the `/proc/self/maps` parser did until 2026-08-22. Above that the whole BSS was dropped from the root set, so every class variable and constant slot holding a heap reference was swept: an 8 MiB static array is enough to get `STDERR` collected and finalized, which closes fd 2. `make static-bss-roots` |
| `GCRY_DYING_AUDIT_ALL_COLLECTIONS=1` | **Research only.** Let `GCRY_THREAD_BLOCK_AUDIT` walk every used block whatever the collection is. "Unmarked" only means "about to be swept" in a **full** collection — a minor marks and reclaims the nursery, so every old live object reads unmarked and reads that way correctly. Without the sweep's own predicate the arm reported **262 live objects as dying** in one run of `stw_mt_property_test --tlab --nursery`, every one a `Thread` its own report said was still on Crystal's list |
| `GCRY_UNOWNED_COVERAGE_AUDIT=1` | **Research only.** Walk `/proc/self/maps` beside the shipped fiber-stack roots and count stack-shaped mappings nothing accounts for. What it cannot account for is the population the in-flight arm walks — `accounted + not` equals `maps_inflight_walked` in every run — so the split is "parked in a `Thread#dying_fiber` slot or not", not "known or unknown". Needs a Parallel context under concurrent spawning; a quiesced single-context program reports 0 either side of a spawn storm |
| `GCRY_MAPS_INFLIGHT_ROOTS` / `GCRY_MAPS_INFLIGHT_NOROOT` | **Research only.** Root (or walk and offer nothing) the fiber-stack-shaped mappings that no fiber, pool or dying-fiber slot accounts for. Each rooting arm has a twin that walks the same memory and offers nothing, which is what separates a fix from a null result |
| `GCRY_INDEX_AUDIT=1` | **Research only**, and it does two things. It counts unlocked chunk-index reads taken during a stop, split by whether the reader is the thread that stopped the world — `chunk_containing` skips `@index_lock` while `@world_stopped` is set, on the grounds that only the collector can be there, and until 2026-08-22 `start_world` cleared that flag *after* resuming every thread (**173 326** foreign reads across 15 runs, 0 after). Counters `index_unlocked_owner` / `index_unlocked_foreign` / `index_unlocked_foreign_id` on `/gc-stats`; `index_cache_torn` counts separately and unconditionally — a last-chunk cache read whose index, bounds and array disagreed, which used to be returned as a chunk and is now a fall-through to the binary search. `make stw-index-race`, `make find-block-race` |
| `GCRY_INDEX_CACHE_UNCHECKED=1` | **Research only.** Restore the last-chunk cache read that crashed `find_block`: the index tested and then read again to index with, no check that the chunk contains the address, and the unsynchronised `invalidate_chunk_cache` outside `@index_lock` that made the second read see `-1`. `@chunk_index[-1]` is libc's malloc header for the array, which is why the bad value was the same constant every time. Takes the `live` and `realloc` arms of `make find-block-race` from 0 of 8 to **8 of 8**, which is what makes their silence with the fix in a measurement |
| `GCRY_TRIM_UNLOCKED=1` | **Research only.** Trim the large-object cache the way it was trimmed before 2026-08-23: without `@alloc_lock`, and unmapping each chunk while still walking `@large_freelists`. `alloc_large` → `take_large_free` walks that same list *holding* the lock and hands a chunk to the mutator, so the two can collide over a chunk that has just been issued. The default detaches under the lock and unmaps after it, which keeps the syscalls out of the lock. Kept because a control has to reproduce the defect and not merely remove the fix: an earlier version of this knob dropped the lock but kept the two-pass structure, and the ordering alone was enough to return 0 of 24 |
| `GCRY_TRIM_IMMEDIATE=1` | **Research only.** Let a mutator's `trim_large_cache` `munmap` its detached chunks on the spot instead of queueing them for the collector — the behaviour before 2026-08-23. The three `flush_pending_*` passes walk `@chunks` after `start_world` holding no lock, and read (the mostly-empty pass writes) every chunk header before testing any flag, so a mutator unmapping underneath them is a use-after-free — or an `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` onto memory the kernel has already reissued. This is the arm `make dormant-flush-race` needs to stay evidence. |
| `GCRY_MADVISE_UNCHECKED=1` | **Research only.** Issue the page-release `madvise` without checking that the range lies inside the chunk it was computed from and inside the heap span. `release_free_pages_in_chunk` derives the range from a chunk header and then checks it against `data_start`/`data_end` *from that same header*, which proves only self-consistency; if a live-world walk steps onto a released or foreign header, the range is whatever is at that address. Measured 0 rejects in 12 runs of `make live-graph-audit`, so the check is an invariant with no behaviour behind it today — which is the point of counting it. |
| `GCRY_PAGE_RELEASE_UNCHECKED=1` | **Research only.** Release a page run without re-reading its block headers first, which is what it did before 2026-08-24. The live-page mask is built by reading every header in the chunk with no lock and the `madvise` goes out afterwards, so blocks allocated in between sit in a range about to be dropped: measured at 30, 31, 5 and 41 live blocks in released runs, against 0 with the walk off. The re-read skips such a run — about 6 per child of `make live-graph-audit`. |
| `GCRY_RELEASE_LEDGER=1` | **Research only.** Record every chunk release — base, length, path, collection — and unmap anyway, so a fault on memory that has since been remapped can still be told what used to be there. `GCRY_UNMAP_GUARD=1` answers the same question by never giving the mapping back, which costs address space and, measured on 2026-08-23, hides faults that need the range to be reused: 14 clean runs of `make live-graph-audit` under the guard against roughly 2 in 12 without it. The ledger is a ring, because a full one stops recording the recent releases a fault is about, and its report says the range was unmapped rather than borrowing the guard's certainty about what is there now. |
| `GCRY_TRACE_LARGE=1` | **Research only.** Raw-write a line for every large chunk mapped — base, chunk size, payload, collection — so a range the ledger names on a fault can be traced back to the allocation that made it. The ledger says what was released; this says what it was. Writes through `write(2)` because it runs on the allocation path and must not allocate. It found the page-release victim: one 77 824-byte map in 186, made before any worker thread started. |
| `GCRY_UNMAP_GUARD=1` | **Research only.** Release a chunk with `mprotect(PROT_NONE)` instead of `munmap`, and keep a record of it: base, length, which release path let it go, and the collection it happened at. A write into released heap memory faults either way, but an unmapped region can only be described as "in no live chunk" — the report cannot say *which* chunk, how big, or when. Under the guard the address is still ours, so it says all four and the offset of the write into the chunk. That is what identified the acikturkiye use-after-free as a **live 69 632-byte large object** rather than an unknown address (`bench/log/linux/2026-08-23-acik-crash/FINDINGS.md`). Costs address space, not memory — `PROT_NONE` drops the pages exactly as `munmap` does. Never a default: the address space is never reused, so a long-running process under it will exhaust it. Bounded at 8192 records; past that it falls back to a real `munmap` and counts the overflow |
| `GCRY_STW_LATE_CLEAR=1` | **Research only.** Clear `@world_stopped` after the resume loop instead of before it — the pre-2026-08-22 ordering, in which every mutator ran briefly with the flag still saying stopped |
| `GCRY_SUSPEND_STALL_SPINS` | Spins the suspend wait takes before it asks whether the thread it is waiting for still exists (default **200 000 000**, roughly a second). The report — `SUSPEND STALLED on thread 0x… — n of m acknowledged` plus `pthread_kill(id, 0)`'s verdict — is armed only when `GCRY_STW_WATCHDOG_MS` is, because asking libc about a handle that may have come out of a freed `Thread` can itself fault. A fault there names the defect; a hang names nothing, and a hang is what six aarch64 jobs produced |
| `GCRY_STW_TEST_SUSPEND_STALL_MS` | **Research only**, default 0. Hold the **suspend** phase open, which `GCRY_STW_TEST_STALL_MS` cannot reach — it holds thread-stacks. The positive control for the report above and for the watchdog's `phase=suspend` line. Never ship non-zero |
| `GCRY_STW_TEST_POSTSUSPEND_STALL_MS` | **Research only.** Hold the suspend phase open after its wait loop has finished, with every thread already acknowledged and the watchdog's breadcrumb cleared. That is the shape aarch64 CI produced, and the report used to read the cleared breadcrumb as "waiting for thread 0x0". `make stw-watchdog` asserts it no longer does. |
| `GCRY_STW_TEST_STOPPED_STALL_MS` | **Research only.** Hold the stop open after `PHASE_STOPPED` is entered — the span between the suspend wait finishing and `PHASE_FLUSH`, which used to be reported as `suspend` and is where the aarch64 hangs land (run `32698202277`: "every thread acknowledged (2 of 2); the stall is after the wait loop"). `make stw-watchdog` asserts the report names `phase=stopped-before-flush`; removing the phase entry makes it red. |
| `GCRY_STW_TEST_PRESUSPEND_STALL_MS` | **Research only.** Stall between entering `PHASE_SUSPEND` and the first `note_suspend` — the handshake and the locks a stop takes before it suspends anyone. That region used to report the *previous* stop's cleared breadcrumb as "every thread acknowledged", because `@@suspend_*` are written only by `note_suspend` and survive between stops. `make stw-watchdog` asserts the report says "never reached the suspend wait" and that no arm claims acknowledgement it did not see; removing the stamping turns both red. |
| `GCRY_EMPTY_FLUSH_UNLOCKED=1` | **Research only.** Tear down the pending empty chunks without `@alloc_lock`, which is what it did before 2026-08-24. `update_heap_bounds_after_unmap` walks `@chunks` under that lock from a mutator's `trim_large_cache`, and `unlink_chunk` leaves the removed chunk's `next` intact, so a walker standing on one follows it into memory the teardown is unmapping. Taking the lock closes that ordering on paper; it did **not** move the observed fault rate (2 of 30 either way), so it is recorded as a discipline fix rather than a measured one. |
| `GCRY_MONITOR_GATE_LATE_CLOSE=1` | **Research only.** Close the Monitor handshake inside `stop_world` — after `@roots_lock` is taken — instead of before it. That ordering deadlocks: `MonitorGate.close` spins until the Monitor's current call ends, and one of those calls reaches `thread_pool.checkout` -> `Thread.new` -> `pthread_create`, which gcry wraps to root the new `Thread` through the very lock the collector is holding. The Monitor is the one thread suspend signals never touch, so nothing breaks it. This is the aarch64 CI hang (`ec-queue-audit`, ten seconds at step "entered, monitor gate not yet closed", run 32725238411). `make monitor-gate-deadlock` needs this arm to wedge. |
| `GCRY_MONITOR_GATE_TEST_SPAWN=1` | **Research only.** Make the real Monitor spawn a thread inside its handshake — what `thread_pool.checkout` does when nothing is parked. A harness thread cannot stand in for the Monitor here: `@@busy` is a single shared bit, so the Monitor's next back-off clears whatever hold the harness took (measured: `stw_waits=1`, `monitor_blocks=12`, no deadlock in either arm). |
| `GCRY_BIRTH_GRACE_MIN` / `GCRY_BIRTH_GRACE_MAX` | Payload-byte window for the birth grace, so it can be aimed at one block shape at a time. Unset means every size, which is what the 20/48 → 0/48 arm measured |
| `GCRY_BIRTH_GRACE_NOROOT=1` | The grace's twin: walk the same ring and root nothing, so a batch that survives is not credited to the walk |
| `GCRY_BIRTH_GRACE_DUMMY=1` | Walk the ring exactly as usual and root a null pointer — the control that separates "rooting the newborn saved it" from "doing anything at all here changed the timing" |
| `GCRY_BIRTH_GRACE_TOUCH=1` | Read each newborn block's header while walking, without rooting it: the same memory traffic, none of the retention |
| `GCRY_DEAD_STACK_ROOTS=0` | Turn **off** rooting the stack a thread holds for a fiber that is ending (`Thread#dying_fiber`), which is the v0.20.0 fix for the fiber-creation use-after-free: 10/24 crashes → 0/24. `GCRY_DEAD_STACK_NOROOT=1` is its twin — same walk, roots nothing, 12/24 |
| `GCRY_POOLED_STACK_ROOTS` / `GCRY_POOLED_STACK_NOROOT` | **Research only.** The same pair for stacks parked in a `Fiber::StackPool` rather than in a dying-fiber slot |
| `GCRY_DYING_REGISTER_AUDIT=1` | **Research only.** At the moment a block dies, report whether its address is in a suspended thread's registers and whether the collecting thread's own stack scan offered it. Implied by `GCRY_ADDRESS_SPACE_AUDIT`, whose walk it triggers; it only inspects blocks at or above the 384-byte band, which is why it could not see a 192-byte `Thread` and `GCRY_THREAD_BLOCK_AUDIT` had to exist |
| `GCRY_MARK_AUDIT_ALL=1` | With `GCRY_MARK_AUDIT`, walk **every** used block as a parent rather than only the marked ones, so an edge from a parent that is itself dying is visible. Louder, and O(live heap) all the same. Its hits do **not** land in `mark_audit_misses` — that counts marked parents only — but in `mark_audit_dying_edges` on `/gc-stats`, and they dominate: 6237 of 6363 edges in a two-second smoke. The per-collection print cap is 4 lines, and ordinary garbage-pointing-at-garbage fills them first, so read the counter rather than the log |
| `GCRY_POST_MARK_SPIN=N` | **Research only.** A pure delay between mark and sweep, with no bookkeeping of any kind. The control every birth-grace arm needed: each arm that walks a table there takes the crash rate to zero, including one that roots a null pointer, so a bare spin doing the same would mean none of them was keeping anything alive |
| `GCRY_SCRUB_AUDIT=1` | **Research only.** Instrument the parked-fiber scrub: read foreign SPs from `/proc/self/task/<tid>/syscall` and separate "SP on a running fiber" from "SP on a parked one", so a zero is readable. Result on the two shapes gcry ships: the wipe never reached a live frame — EC1 200/200 collections, EC4 1170 sightings, all on fibers excluded as `running?` before any scrub logic ran |
| `GCRY_SCRUB_OVERSHOOT=<bytes>` | **Research only**, default 0. Slide the parked-fiber wipe *above* `stack_top`, into live frames, so the sweep carries its own positive control. Clean through **56** bytes of overshoot on x86_64 and corrupt at 60; on aarch64 clean through 64 and corrupt at 72 — both are the saved return address, so the margin is zero. `make scrub-margin` |
| `GCRY_PRECISE_FIBERS=1` | **Research.** With stack maps loaded, use them for parked fiber stacks too instead of word-scanning them |
| `GCRY_PRECISE_FIBER_LEAF=<bytes>` | **Research.** Bytes below a parked fiber's SP still word-scanned under `PRECISE_FIBERS` (default **8192**) |
| `GCRY_TYPE_ID_GATE=1` | Extend the root `type_id` filter to stack candidates as well, which the default leaves ungated |
| `GCRY_MOSTLY_EMPTY=1` | `MADV_FREE` the free pages of chunks that are ≤25% live (content preserved, freelist stays valid). `GCRY_MOSTLY_EMPTY_MODE=dontneed` unlinks free-only runs and `MADV_DONTNEED`s them instead (churn risk); `GCRY_MOSTLY_EMPTY_PCT` moves the liveness threshold and `GCRY_MOSTLY_EMPTY_BUDGET` caps the bytes per collection |
| `GCRY_NO_INCREMENTAL=1` | Alias for `GCRY_DISABLE_INCREMENTAL=1` |
| `GCRY_STW_TEST_STALL_MS` | **Research only**, default 0. Hold the world stopped inside the thread-stacks phase for this long, so the watchdog above has a run it is expected to fire on (`make stw-watchdog`). Freezes every mutator on purpose — never ship non-zero |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_LAZY_SWEEP` | Force in-STW sweep (default: EC1 and Parallel reclaim-off / TLAB-off sweep after `start_world`) |
| `GCRY_BLACKLIST=1` | Force page blacklist on (already process default) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_BLACKLIST=1` | No page blacklist |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_STATIC_ROOTS=1` | Skip dyld/ELF static root scan (debug; unsafe) |
| `GCRY_LIVE_ATTR=1` | Research: first-mark root-source counters; pair with `/gc-live-attr` |
| `GCRY_LIVE_ATTR_WATCH_TID` | Research: first-mark counts for one type_id (`first_mark_watch_*`; implies LIVE_ATTR) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_FIBER_FP_FILL=1` | With `PRECISE_FIBERS`: skip FP-frame conservative fill (pure maps; UAF risk) |
| `GCRY_FIBER_FP_FILL_MISS_ONLY=1` | With `PRECISE_FIBERS`: skip FP-fill on nonempty map hits (research; acik UAF) |
| `GCRY_STACKMAP_MISS_LOG=1` | Research: parked map-miss PC ring on `/gc-stats` (`stack_maps_top_miss_pcs`) |
| `GCRY_STACKMAP_NEAR_DELTA` | Research: ret↔map slack bytes (default **128**; was 32 — too tight for arg pushes) |
| `GCRY_TLAB=1` | **Unsupported** under Parallel — thread-local freelists (research/A/B; stderr warn). Supported path keeps TLAB **off** |
| `GCRY_ALLOC_BATCH=N` | TLAB-off: claim N (1..64) freelist nodes per lock; USED stash (lazy-safe) |
| `GCRY_CLEAR_STACK=1` | Unused-stack wipe on alloc (RSS experiment; every **16**) |
| `GCRY_CLEAR_STACK_BYTES` | Wipe size (default **4096**) |
| `GCRY_CLEAR_STACK_EVERY` | Wipe every N allocs |
| `GCRY_SCRUB_FIBERS=1` | Parked-fiber scrub on (**opt-in** on tip; was the process default) |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_SCRUB_FIBERS=1` | Disable parked-fiber scrub |
| `GCRY_FIBER_SCRUB_BYTES` | Parallel parked-fiber wipe below SP (default **512**; 64..8192) |
| `GCRY_PARALLEL_MARK=N` | **Experimental** mark workers — HTTP thr often **regresses** |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_MADVISE=1` | Skip free-page physical release helpers |
| `GCRY_DISABLE_ATFORK=1` | No atfork; post-fork GC raises |
| `GCRY_DEBUG_INVARIANTS=1` | Runtime heap invariant checks |
| `GCRY_TRACE=1` | NDJSON GC event log (stderr or `GCRY_TRACE_FILE`) |
| `GCRY_TRACE_FILE` | Trace output path |
| `GCRY_TRACE_ALLOC_SAMPLE` | Log 1/N alloc/free lines (default **1000**; `0` = off) |

## False retention

Conservative GC keeps any aligned word that **looks** like a heap pointer.

Common sources: stale stack slots, integer bit patterns, broad static scans.

Mitigations already on by default: empty-chunk release, base-ptr roots, type_id gate, layout builtins, SP clamp, blacklist. Fiber scrub is **opt-in** on tip (`GCRY_SCRUB_FIBERS=1`) — it cut false retention, but nothing measured kept its default alive. Linux HOLED page release is opt-in (`GCRY_PAGE_DONTNEED=1`). Opt-in `GCRY_CLEAR_STACK=1` wipes **unused** stack on alloc — not stack maps. Closing dense-live RSS on fat apps needs the compiler.

### Diagnosing via `/gc-stats`

Per-source root reject counters tell you where false roots come from:

| Field | Source | When to act |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `type_id_stack_rejects` | Fiber/mutator stacks | Stale slot; consider `GCRY_CLEAR_STACK=1` |
| `type_id_static_rejects` | BSS/data segments | Library has wide globals; no good fix at GC level |
| `type_id_thread_rejects` | Thread TLS | Worker stack slack; review thread count |
| `type_id_root_false_negatives` | Rejected roots later proved valid | **UAF risk**: gate is too strict, raise `1_000_000` upper bound |

`stack_rejects + static_rejects + thread_rejects == type_id_root_rejects`. Any non-zero `false_negatives` is a production alarm.

### Nursery survival metrics

| Field | Meaning | Tuning |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `nursery_survival_bytes` | Surviving payload from the last minor | High → grow threshold; low → shrink |
| `nursery_alloc_before_minor` | Nursery alloc bytes at the start of the last minor | Compare with survival_bytes for rate |
| `nursery_survival_rate_pct` | Moving-average survival rate (last 10 minors) | Target is 50%; >80% → threshold grows; <25% → shrinks |
| `adaptive_nursery` | Whether adaptive auto-tuning is active | Set via heap property or `GCRY_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_NURSERY` |

```crystal
before = GC.stats.heap_size
# drop refs…
GC.collect
after = GC.stats.heap_size
```

Watch `unmapped_bytes` / RSS. Large objects (&gt;32 KiB) stay on a freelist through STW; excess trimmed after (`GCRY_LARGE_CACHE`).

## Process GC (HTTP)

ExecutionContext does not call `set_stackbottom` on swap — gcry refreshes from `Fiber.current` at collect. STW suspends other OS threads (Monitor included); without it, HTTP heaps corrupt under load.

Static roots: main executable RW (+ adjacent BSS); skip `.so` data and large RELRO. Fiber stacks scanned once per collect.

Parallel contexts: STW covers Crystal threads. **Supported opt-in:**
`EC_PARALLELISM>1`, **`GCRY_TLAB` off**, lazy sweep on (default) — thr
~**80%** `/json` @ ~5.5× RSS; `GCRY_PARALLEL_DORMANT=1` for RSS ~**75%**
@ ~4× — [PERF.md](PERF.md). Correctness gate: `make soft-soak-ec4`
(soft+hard **0/40**); CI runs `make soft-soak-ec4-smoke` (N=5).
`GCRY_TLAB=1` and `GCRY_PARALLEL_RELEASE` are **unsupported** (knobs
kept for research; process GC prints a stderr warning). Soft-soak refuses
both. `GCRY_PARALLEL_MARK` is research — [POLICY.md](POLICY.md).

## CI

Format, specs, `-Dgc_none` samples, env smoke, `bench/churn`, `soak-smoke`,
and EC4 soft-soak smoke on Linux x86_64 (Crystal 1.21 + latest). aarch64
native and `macos-latest` for STW/fork samples. `perf-smoke` gates Kemal
`/json` same-host thr % (`MIN_PCT=70`), post-GC RSS × (`MAX_RSS_X=1.25`),
and `pause_p50` (`MAX_PAUSE_P50_MS=2.5`) via `bench/perf_smoke.sh`.

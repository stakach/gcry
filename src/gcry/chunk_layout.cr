    # Where a size-class chunk's bitmaps live, and how an address inside it
    # becomes a block ordinal.
    #
    # ## Bitmaps inside the chunk
    #
    # `occ` and `mark` sit between the `ChunkHeader` and the first block, so a
    # chunk's metadata is one contiguous run, the bitmaps are freed with the
    # chunk, and there is no side arena to allocate, free-list or keep alive.
    # Worst case is class 0: 64 words each, 1024 B of a 128 KiB chunk, 0.78%.
    #
    # The reason this is safe against `MADV_DONTNEED` is worth stating, because
    # it is inherited rather than designed. `release_free_pages_in_chunk`
    # (collect_sweep.cr) builds page runs from `data0 & ~(page-1)` — the chunk
    # base, since chunks are page-aligned — but releases a run only when
    # `run_start >= data0` (collect_sweep.cr:1175, and the twin at :803). Since
    # `data_start` is strictly inside page 0, a run starting at page 0 always
    # fails that test, so **page 0 is never released**. That was already true of
    # the 24-byte header; moving `data_start` forward keeps it true for free.
    # The other two release sites round *up* from `data_start` (:615, :1059) and
    # so cannot reach the bitmaps either.
    #
    # The invariant that rests on is asserted, not assumed:
    # `data_offset < Platform.host_page_size` — the whole metadata region lives
    # in page 0. It holds with margin everywhere gcry runs (1056 B for a 128 KiB
    # chunk, 2080 B for Darwin's 256 KiB, against a 4 KiB or 16 KiB page); a
    # future chunk size that broke it would put bitmap bytes in page 1, which
    # *is* releasable.
    #
    # ## Sizing is a fixed point, resolved by rounding up
    #
    # `bitmap_words` depends on the block count, which depends on `data_offset`,
    # which depends on `bitmap_words`. Sizing from the block count a chunk would
    # hold with *no* bitmap (`n0`) always over-estimates, so the bitmap is
    # always at least large enough. The few unused tail bits are what
    # `tail_mask` exists to mask off — `~occ` would otherwise offer blocks past
    # `data_end`.

    # The largest chunk for which the shift-40 reciprocal below is exact.
    #
    # With `e = magic*d - 2^40`, the first offset where `(off*magic) >> 40`
    # disagrees with `off // d` is `2^40 / e`. Across the 40 size classes the
    # tightest is `block_bytes = 24592`, which first fails at 86.3 MiB. 64 MiB
    # is that bound rounded down to something memorable, and it is 512x the
    # 128 KiB default and 256x Darwin's 256 KiB. `GCRY_CHUNK_BYTES` is
    # user-settable with no upper bound (gc_override.cr), which is why this is
    # checked rather than trusted.

# Is the runtime's thread list still readable when `stop_world` reaches it?
#
# The oldest open crash in this tree is a fault at address `0x18` inside
# `stop_world`:
#
#     pthread_mutex_lock <- Thread::Mutex#lock <- Thread::lock
#     <- Gcry::Heap#stop_world
#
# `Thread::Mutex#lock` is a real frame, so the receiver was fetched and then
# `pointerof(@mutex)` came out at `0x18` — a null reference, not a stray
# pointer. The reference lives in `Thread::LinkedList`'s `@mutex`, a field of a
# heap object written once during boot and only ever read afterwards. A field of
# a live object reading zero is what a released page leaves behind.
#
# Every instrument aimed at this so far has gone quiet, and gone quiet for the
# same reason: it watched objects the *harness* owns, and the victim here is one
# the runtime allocated before any harness existed
# (`bench/log/linux/2026-08-23-threads-null-0x18/FINDINGS.md`).
#
# This one watches the victim. If the list object's memory has been zeroed then
# `@head` is zero along with `@mutex`, so a walk that yields nothing is the same
# damage the fault is about — reported one instruction *before* the fault, with
# the collection number, instead of as an unexplained signal afterwards.
#
# The walk is unlocked on purpose: `Thread.lock` is the call being protected, so
# taking it first would defeat the point. That is safe here in the only sense
# that matters — a concurrent `push` can make the walk miss a node, and missing
# a node cannot turn a non-empty list into an empty one, because a push writes
# `@head` last.
#
# `GCRY_THREAD_LIST_TRIPWIRE=1`, and off by default, because the walk is not
# free of hazards of its own: a worker thread that has exited has removed
# itself from the list and its `Thread` object is ordinary garbage, so an
# unlocked walk that reads a stale `next` can follow it into a chunk gcry has
# legitimately released. A fault raised *by the instrument* under those rules
# says nothing about the defect it was built for, and it looks identical in a
# log. Default-off keeps the two apart: every arm can be run with the walk and
# without it.
#
# Silence is not an answer on its own, so the walk also records the largest
# count it has seen. A tripwire that reports zero threads on a run whose maximum
# was also zero never saw the list at all.
#
# 2026-08-27, after the first batch: the walk's own faults said the list holds
# large-block user pointers (`+0x50` = a bogus node at `chunk base + 0x28`,
# which is exactly `ChunkHeader::SIZE + BlockHeader::SIZE`), so the watch below
# was added. It records the list object's address at the first walk and then
# every large-cache insertion, large-cache hand-out, release, and page-madvise
# range is checked against it — the corrupting *event* named at its own call
# site, instead of the crash that follows it
# (`bench/log/linux/2026-08-27-thread-list-tripwire/FINDINGS.md`).

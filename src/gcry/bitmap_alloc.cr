    # Bitmap-driven small allocation: the `occ` half of the representation.
    #
    # ## Why this cannot be split from the sweep
    #
    # `occ` says which blocks are allocated. It is only sound if *allocation
    # itself* sets the bit — an `occ` maintained beside a freelist is the design
    # `bench/log/linux/2026-08-01-ec4-alloc-bits/summary.md` rejected at
    # `/json` 54k → 44k, and `-ec4-used-count-v2` names the failure class:
    # "accounting that enables skip is not free on the HTTP alloc path".
    #
    # It is tempting to think `occ` could be derived purely at sweep time, since
    # the sweep publishes `occ = mark`. It cannot: between two sweeps the
    # allocator would see every block allocated since the last one as free in
    # `~occ` and hand out live memory. So the bit is set on the allocation path
    # or the representation is wrong — and the only way that is affordable is
    # for the allocation path to already hold the chunk.
    #
    # ## The pool cursor is what makes it affordable
    #
    # Per size class the heap keeps `{chunk, word, free_mask, word_base}`. The
    # fast path is: `tzcnt` the cached mask, clear that bit from it, set the
    # `occ` bit, return `word_base + ordinal * block_bytes`. **No chunk lookup,
    # no freelist chase, no dependent load through free memory.** The size-class
    # lock is taken once per *word* of 64 blocks rather than once per block.
    #
    # That is the whole reason a chunk lookup may never appear here: 2026-08-01's
    # v1 added `chunk_containing` per small allocation and took quiet `/json` to
    # **56.3%** of Boehm.
    #
    # ## The free mask is not `~occ`
    #
    # Three corrections, each of which would otherwise hand out memory that must
    # not be handed out:
    #
    # - **Tail bits.** A 128 KiB class-0 chunk holds 4063 blocks in a 4096-bit
    #   map, so `~occ` offers 33 slots past `data_end`.
    # - **Released pages.** `rebuild_size_class_freelist` deliberately omits free
    #   blocks sitting on `MADV_DONTNEED`'d page runs (collect_sweep.cr), because
    #   handing one back refaults a page that was just released and, on the
    #   DONTNEED path, returns a zeroed header. `~occ` knows nothing about that.
    # - **Blacklisted pages.** A page the blacklist has excluded must not be
    #   allocated from at all.
    #
    # So the mask is `~occ & tail_mask & usable_mask`, where `usable_mask` is
    # built once per chunk when the chunk enters the pool rather than per word.

    # Pool cursor, one per size class. `@pool_free_mask` is the live one: a set
    # bit is a free block in `@pool_word` of `@pool_chunk`.

    # `@chunk_list_lock` hang, one lock over), so it nulled the cursor unlocked,
    # and the mutator resumed into `occ_bitmap(null)`: `signal 11 at 0x1c`,
    # `0x1c` being exactly the `bitmap_words` field offset. Proved by
    # instrumentation — every drop that matched a live cursor came from the
    # stopped-world sweep, none from `index_remove`.
    #
    # Pinning closes a second window the drop could not: a mutator frozen

# Entrypoint for kcov — requires all spec files.
# kcov needs a binary, not `crystal spec`, so we build this as a standalone
# executable that runs the full spec suite.
#
# NOTE: softdirty_spec is excluded because it depends on /proc/self/clear_refs
# which behaves differently in a standalone binary vs crystal spec (which forks
# per-file). It's still run via `crystal spec` in CI.

# The regression specs moved to `process_spec/regression/` on 2026-08-15. They
# call `GC.malloc` / `GC.collect`, and gcry only takes over `GC` under
# `-Dgc_none` — measured: without the flag, three `GC.collect` calls move gcry's
# collection count 0 → 0 and `GC.malloc`'s result is not in gcry's heap. Here
# they were exercising Boehm.

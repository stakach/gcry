# Per-chunk mark bitmaps (`GCRY_BITMAP=1`).
#
# The claim under test is not "the bitmap works" but "the bitmap and the header
# generation decide the same live set". A mark representation that disagrees
# with the old one by a single object is a use-after-free or a leak, and neither
# announces itself, so the important spec here is the A/B: run the same graph
# through two heaps that differ only in representation and require the same
# survivors.
# Both arms are set explicitly rather than left to `Heap.new`'s default,
# because that default reads `GCRY_BITMAP` from the environment — so under
# `GCRY_BITMAP=1 crystal spec` an implicit "header" arm would silently be a
# second bitmap arm and the A/B below would compare a thing to itself.
#
# Safe in both helpers and only here: no chunk has been carved yet.
# `data_offset` is baked into every chunk at map time, so flipping this later
# would leave chunks whose blocks start somewhere the heap no longer believes
# they do — which is what the setter refuses.
# Both arms also disable the nursery, and that is not incidental. A library
# heap enables it by default, and nursery chunks deliberately keep the header
# representation — their allocation still runs through `alloc_nursery`'s
# freelist, so `occ` is not maintained for them (nursery-on-bitmaps is Phase 8).
# With the nursery on, the bitmap arm would allocate through the freelist and
# these specs would exercise the header path under a bitmap name.

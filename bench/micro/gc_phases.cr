# Steady-state GC workload with a tunable survival rate, reporting per-phase
# timings and — the reason this exists — the **GC duty cycle**.
#
# ## Why
#
# `2026-09-03-simdgc-chunk-radix-ab` measured `phase_mark` down 10-18% from the
# O(1) chunk table and could not see it in Kemal throughput at all. The reason
# was not noise. Kemal spends **0.2-0.5% of wall time stopped for GC**, and
# `phase_mark` is 29% of that, so an *infinitely fast* mark is worth +0.15pp
# end to end. Every mark-side phase in the plan was being gated on an axis it
# cannot move by more than a rounding error.
#
# A benchmark cannot fix that, but it can stop the project guessing. This one
# reports duty cycle as a first-class number so a workload can be **chosen by
# measurement** rather than assumed to be GC-bound — and it sweeps survival rate,
# which is the parameter that actually controls it: garbage is cheap (a dead
# object costs a bit in a bitmap), survivors are expensive (each one is a mark,
# a trace, and a retained page).
#
# The plan (`simd_plan/gcry-simdgc-plan.md` §6) asked for this as a port of
# `bench4.c`. It should have been built before the phases it exists to judge.
#
# ## Shape
#
# A ring of `live` slots is overwritten in place, so the live set is bounded and
# steady while allocation continues indefinitely — the same steady state
# `bench4.c` uses. Survival rate is the fraction of allocations that land in the
# ring rather than being dropped immediately.
#
# Usage:
#   crystal build --release -Dgc_none bench/micro/gc_phases.cr -o bin/gc_phases
#   ./bin/gc_phases [--seconds=N] [--live=N] [--survival=0.1,0.5,0.9] [--size=N]
#
# Output: JSON lines to stdout.

# This is not a cosmetic knob. In allocation order the ring's pointers are
# chunk-sequential, so `chunk_containing`'s one-slot cache answers nearly every
# lookup and the binary search it exists to avoid barely runs — a workload that
# looks GC-bound but exercises no chunk *lookup* pressure at all. Real mark
# graphs (Kemal's JSON, `exp.c`'s shuffled shapes) are scattered, and
# `simdgc-perf-notes.md` measured graph shape dominating everything else in the
# mark phase. Without this the benchmark silently answers a different question
# from the one a chunk-lookup change is asking.

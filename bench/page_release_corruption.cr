# Does the default page-release walk zero live objects?
#
# `flush_pending_page_release_chunks` runs after `start_world` — mutators live —
# and on Linux walks every HOLED chunk. For each it calls
# `release_free_pages_in_chunk(..., preserve_content: false)`, which builds a
# live-page mask by reading every `BlockHeader.free?` in the chunk **holding no
# lock**, and then `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`s the page runs the mask calls free.
#
# A block that reads free during the mask walk can be handed to a mutator and
# written before the syscall lands. DONTNEED does not wait for memory pressure
# the way MADV_FREE does: the page is zeroed there and then, and the object in
# it reads back as zeros.
#
# `heap.release_empty_chunks` is `true` in `GC.init` and the call site is
# unconditional, so this is the default configuration on Linux. No knob.
#
# This gate does not wait for a crash. Every live object carries a checksum
# derived from its own identity; the workers verify what they hold on every
# round. Zeroed memory fails the check whether or not it ever gets dereferenced
# as a pointer, which is the only way to see a defect whose whole nature is that
# it leaves no trace.
#
#   holes    allocate many, keep one in eight — the survivors leave whole pages
#            free inside an otherwise-live chunk, which is what HOLED means
#   verify   re-check every survivor each round
#
#   default                      must be clean
#   GCRY_DISABLE_PAGE_RELEASE=1  must also be clean — if it is not, the walk is
#                                not what is doing the damage and this harness
#                                is measuring something else
#
# The verifier itself was checked by zeroing a held object on purpose: it
# reported 40 corrupt, 40 of them entirely zero. A checksum gate that cannot be
# shown to fail is not a gate.
#
# As of 2026-08-23 the HOLED arm does not pass. It faults about one run in six,
# and not on a checksum — on an address the report places inside the heap span
# and in no live chunk, reached through the worker's own live array. That is a
# released chunk holding a live object, not a zeroed page. 7 of 40 with the walk
# on, 0 of 40 with it off.
# See `bench/log/linux/2026-08-23-holed-release-uaf/`.
#
# Raise `PAGE_RELEASE_ATTEMPTS` when hunting rather than guarding — four per arm
# is a smoke test, and four cannot separate 0 % from 10 %.

# `find_block` from a mutator thread, while collections run, used to crash.
#
# The last-chunk cache in `chunk_containing_unlocked` tested `@last_chunk_idx`
# and then **read it again** to index with. Those are two loads, and a
# concurrent `invalidate_chunk_cache` between them turns a guard that saw a
# valid index into a read at `@chunk_index[-1]` — libc's malloc header for the
# array. That is why the bad value was the same small constant every single
# time: `0x91`, handed to `ChunkHeader.large?`, which is where the crash lands.
# One of the writers was unsynchronised too: a second `invalidate_chunk_cache`
# outside `@index_lock`, on the path every allocating thread takes when it maps
# a chunk.
#
# It needed a mutator *inside* `find_block`, which is what took four sessions to
# find: allocation at the same rate never crashes, because it does not look
# chunks up. `GC.realloc` and `Heap#live?` reach it by different routes and
# crashed alike, and TLAB reaches it on the allocation fast path — which is why
# the CI sighting was on the `--tlab --nursery` arm and nowhere else.
#
# Measured, four threads and 200 collections:
#
#              before      with the fix
#   alloc      0 of 8      0 of 8
#   idle       0 of 8      0 of 8
#   live       5 of 8      0 of 8
#   realloc    5 of 8      0 of 8
#
# And the race is not rare — it is constant. `index_cache_torn` counts a cache
# read whose index, bounds and array disagreed and which fell through to the
# binary search instead of trusting any of them: **7 849 in one run** of the
# `live` arm. It was firing thousands of times per run all along and only
# occasionally landing on a value that killed the process.
#
# The control arm pins GCRY_CHUNK_RADIX=0: the O(1) chunk table bypasses the
# cache read this gate certifies, so an inherited radix would make the
# control unable to crash and the gate unable to fail.
#
#   GCRY_INDEX_CACHE_UNCHECKED=1 restores both halves — the two-load read and
#   the unsynchronised invalidation — and takes `live` and `realloc` to **8 of
#   8**. Without that arm, "it does not crash any more" is not a measurement.

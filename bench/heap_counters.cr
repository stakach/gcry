# Do the allocation counters keep what they are given?
#
# `note_alloc_bytes` updates `live_objects` / `total_bytes` / `bytes_since_gc`
# with plain `set(get + n)` unless `heap_counters_atomic` is set, and two
# threads running that lose increments outright — measured as the process
# heap's counter permanently behind in 3 runs of 40, and as the residual
# failures of `spec/invariant_spec.cr` before the invariant learned to state
# itself only of a heap that can keep it (src/gcry/invariant.cr).
#
# The counters now flip to atomic the moment a **second thread is created**
# (`GC.pthread_create`), so a program that cannot race keeps the cheap path and
# one that can keeps its numbers. This gate is that claim, in both directions:
#
#   atomic    two threads allocate a known number of objects; the counter must
#             account for **every one** of them.
# The plain arm also pins `GCRY_BITMAP_ALLOC=0`. The bitmap allocator *implies*
# atomic counters — its streaming sweep settles a chunk's reclaim with one
# batched `live_objects_sub`, which a non-atomic get/set loses wholesale — so an
# inherited `GCRY_BITMAP_ALLOC=1` keeps the plain path from ever running and the
# control cannot lose the increments it exists to lose. Measured: `lost 0` where
# the arm requires a loss, and the gate correctly refused to certify the other
# arm on the strength of it.
#
#   plain     `GCRY_HEAP_COUNTERS_ATOMIC=0` puts the old path back, and the same
#             workload must **lose** some. Without this arm the first one is
#             just a run that happened not to race.
#
# The GC is disabled for the workload: a collection recomputes what a sweep
# finds, and this asks about the increment path, not about the sweep.
